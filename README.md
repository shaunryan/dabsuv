3. initialise with uv `uv init --package --name=manisha .`
4. add databricks-connect and any other dev dependencies `uv add --dev 'databricks-connect`
5. sync and create the venv `uv sync`
6. Go through the rest of the configuration steps on the databricks connect setup using the extension; select the cluster, setup databricks connect etc
7. Setup your entry points in the `./project.toml` to your code entry points under the `[project.scripts]` config section
8. Add the uv build into the `./databricks.yml` under the artefact definition
9. Wire up the entry points to the workflow tasks in `./resources/manisha.job.yml`
